MvxPlugins
==========

This repository is a collection of plugins for MvvmCross. Currently it consists of the following plugins:

- **AppId** A plugin for genererating a Unique application ID and get some basic information about the phone
- **Azure Access Control** This plugin provides Authentication against Windows Azure ACS (don't confuse it with Windows Azure Mobile Services).
- **Settings** A plugin for saving simple key/value kind of settings into persistant storage
- **SimpleWebToken** A plugin to create SimpleWebToken's from raw representations and to generate your own.
- More to come! If you have a good idea, feel free to pitch it with me.
